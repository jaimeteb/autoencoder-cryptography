% Conclusion

Autoencoder neural networks are powerful and versatile tools that can be used for a variety of applications. It is possible to apply this technology in the field of cryptography. As we discussed previously, the advantages of autoencoders are that they are easy to implement, and they can be trained with either small or large datasets. The results from the case study show significant drawbacks regarding encrypted message size. We conclude that autoencoders can be used for lossless encryption, although it would take a more sophisticated system to achieve lossless encryption with a reasonable message size.
